        <b>Term Overview:</b><br>

        The term ended hecticly with the disruption of in-class courses caused by COVID-19. Despite this, the professors and the university pulled through, and I was able to finish the term online on a strong note. I did have time to sneak in a conference before the pandemic fully hit Canada; I attended the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI, where I listened to various talks and workshops, such as a keynote by Geoffrey Hinton.

        <img src="images/WARATAH.jpg" alt="Waratah" height=70> <br>

        I worked as a part of a two-person investment team with a mandate to purchase RV resorts across Canada. I was very fortunate to have an amazing boss and mentor who was kind enough to share his decades of experience and expertise in making deals. I worked on all aspects of the M&A deal process, from constructing LBO and CCA tax schedule models, to preparing presentations, analysis, and forecasts for board and investment committee meetings. I also worked on ad hoc assignments, such as constructing a proprietary database of all RV resorts in Ontario and conducting due diligence assessments. I really enjoyed the versatility of the role as I had the opportunity to work on the operational side of the business, such as engaging with portfolio resort managers to establish budgets and processes. Through this term, I learned a great deal about operating a business and investing in real estate.

        <b>Term Overview:</b><br>

        I was extremely productive this term, having completed various courses on topics which I'm interested in. In particular, I became very bullish on the field of machine learning after learning about the technical details of the different algorithms, and recognizing how seemingly simple they are: just throw data at an algorithm and it calibrates itself. I believe that the incredible things which can be accomplished by such a simple concept is astounding, and we are only witnessing a small fraction of what is possible. In this term, I also took part in the <b>Integrated Case Exercise (ICE)</b>, the 3rd-year Laurier case competition; my team and I went to the semi-finals by recommending a smart city strategy for the region of Kitchener-Waterloo.

        <img src="images/Cambridge.png" alt="Cambridge GAM" height=70> <br>

        I had excellent mentors who showed me the ropes of investing, from using Bloomberg and FactSet, to building three-statement models and interviewing company directors. I had a lot of freedom to conduct my own research and form my own conclusions about different companies. I also undertook projects such as using VBA to build data-visualization tools on portfolio metrics. My greatest takeaway from this work term, however, was not the financial/investing knowledge, but the Cambridge mentality, to be humble, to abhor complacency, and to be conscientious of one's own work and responsibilities. Overall I had an incredible time at Cambridge and although I learned a great deal about investing and research, I realize that I have yet to scratch the surface on all the knowledge about markets and equities; there is much to learn.

        It was pretty interesting to be on the other side of the podium; I definitely sympathize much more with profs who have to talk for hours without break. Economics was always something that interested me so it was fun teaching it to first-year BBA and Economics students; I learned many tricks to be a better teacher, including finding relatable examples and connecting with students on a personal level by avoiding overly complex language.

        My first internship was as a <b>Corporate Banking Intern</b> at <b>China Merchants Bank</b>.<br>
        <img src="images/CMB.png" alt="CMB" height=80><br>

        My duties included handling different aspects of client-facing situations. From pitching new financial products to delivering tutorials on new systems, I had contacted over 1000 corporate clients, ranging from start-ups to multi-billion-dollar corporations. I had two main objectives for pursuing an internship in China: I wanted to improve my Mandarin and I wanted to acclimate myself to the Chinese business environment. My proficiency in Mandarin certainly improved through practice, such as creating pitch decks in both English and Mandarin, and I learned a great deal about how business is conducted in China, such as the emphasis on courtesy (Á§º) and personal connections. I believe that China will continue to play a larger role in the global economy, and this internship has given me crucial insights and skills to understand how this market works.

        <b>Term Overview:</b><br>

        My second semester at university was a trial and error process. I dedicated time to cultivating proper work ethics and discpline. I felt that I was much more deliberate in everything I did and as a result I had more time to engage in extracurriculars. I was invited to participate in the <b>Undergraduate Mock Trials</b> organized by CLAUSE, where I learned a great deal about legal trials, and my team broke through the prelims. <br>

        <b>Term Overview:</b><br>

        I'd be lying if I said that my first semester at university was easy; I had a tough time finding a balance in my hectic university schedule running between two campuses and I had a proverbial "trial by fire" learning to code for the first time. Furthermore, having only gotten grades of 90+s in high school, getting grades in the 70s and 80s in university really took down my confidence. Despite this, I felt that I progressed much in this term, not only academically, in picking up programming, but also in terms of perspective. I learned to be humble, to have humility in both success and failure, and to not compare my personal progress with others'. I attended several debate club meetings and played some intramural basketball, but I mainly spent time alone in the gym or reading philosophy. Overall, it was clear that I needed to grow and adapt.

        <b>Waterloo Courses:</b><br>

        <b><u>CS 135</u>: Designing Functional Programs</b> - Having never written a single line of code before university, I learned a great deal about the fundamentals of programming. I learned about how to think logically and how to code, with an emphasis on recursive functions and edge-case testing. The course was taught in the beginner-friendly but commercially useless language of Dr. Racket.<br>
        <b><u>MATH 135</u>: Algebra for Honours Mathematics</b> - This was my first taste of "real math", having to actually think critically to solve the problems. I learned a great deal about the seemingly archaic language of mathematics as well as proof techniques such as contrapositive and induction.<br>
        <b><u>MATH 137</u>: Calculus I for Honours Mathematics</b> - Having taken IB math in high school, a substantial portion of this course was review for me. Despite this, I still learned a great deal about different problem solving techniques, such as Newton's method, as well as core calculus concepts, such as Taylor polynomials.

        After observing the difficulties our grandparents experienced in their day-to-day activities when coming to visit us in Canada, my friend and I decided to start a course to teach Chinese seniors English. We partnered with the Ottawa Chinese Community Service Centre, which provided us with resources, such as a classroom and teaching supplies. My friend and I recruited two of our peers and, together, created lesson plans as well as lesson hand-outs. The lessons were a huge success and we started a second course, to teach Chinese Seniors how to use digital technology. The courses were featured in articles in local Chinese community newspapers and we made many meaningful connections with our elderly students.
